# DS-SFFNet
Deep supervision spatial Feature Fusion convolutional network (DS-SFFNet) is an end-to-end liver and liver tumor segmentation neural network, which based on deep supervision mechnaism and residual attention mechnaism. 

This work used [miriambellver's work](https://github.com/imatge-upc/liverseg-2017-nipsws) and modified it to achieve our purpose.
